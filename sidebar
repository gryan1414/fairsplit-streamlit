    **FairSplit AI** uses real or simulated energy usage (in kWh) to:
    
    1. **Measure** how much electricity each room uses  
    2. **Calculate** each room's fair share of the total bill  
    3. **Compare** that to a traditional equal split  
    4. **Show** who overpays or saves with FairSplit ðŸŽ¯
    
    This demo uses 4 sample rooms over 30 days. You control the total bill with the slider!
